This file lists various prospective things to do with STLport.

Please feel free to contribute to implementing any of these.
Please submit results back to STLport coordinator 
( fbp@stlport.org, http://www.stlport.org/forum ).

Below, numbers in "[]" brackets indicate priority.

[1] Make sure that the libary compiled with thread support, 
is binary compatible with _NOTHREADS compiled projects. Hint - now it's NOT. 

[1] Implement some version-checking engine within STLport library to make
sure it is impossible to link against wrong STLport library version.

[1] More makefiles in src directory.

[1] More detailed installation/build instructions.

[2] More detailed documentation.

[1] User-friendly installation scripts.

[3] iostreams efficiency analysis.

[3] iostream/STL benchmarking against other implementations.

[2] Add standalone HTML documentation to the distribution
    (almost done).

[3] An "undef" script to expand macros and produce more readable
STLport headers customized for given configuration automatically.

[1] More points to add to this file ;).
