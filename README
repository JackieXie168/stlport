*************************************************************
Getting STLport

Download the latest STLport release from http://www.stlport.org.

*************************************************************
Installing STLport

Unpack the distribution. 

What's in there :

stl                     - header files 
test                    - test suites
export                  - file list

If your compiler is listed below as "auto-recognized", 
you are ready to use STLport. 
Otherwise, run "config/configure" utility (if you are not on UNIX platform,
get cygwin package from www.cygnus.com). 
Make sure you included STLport directory into the search path 
for your compiler.

*************************************************************
Abstract

STLport provides a framework for easy porting of generic C++ 
code among different compilers.
For compilers with limited capabilities, the effort was to
retain original SGI STL functionality as much as possible.
It also features debug mode that helps you debug programs
written with STL.

*************************************************************
